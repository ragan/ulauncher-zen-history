# Ulauncher Zen History
![screenshot](screenshot.png)
### [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io) extension for quickly accessing already visited websites in Zen browser.

## Use
> zh 

List the five most popular websites in Zen history.

> zh query

List the five most popular websites in Zen history that match the query.

## Settings

The search results can be **aggregated by hostname**, so that visiting _twitter.com/UlauncherApp_ and _twitter.com/github_ generates _twitter.com_ as a result.

The **number of results** and the **popularity criteria** can be changed in the extension's settings. The popularity can be determined by last visit date, visit count, or a custom heuristic similar to [Zen Frecency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm).

## Install
> https://github.com/rmassidda/ulauncher-zen-history

Copy and paste this repository link inside __Add extension__ in Ulauncher's settings panel.
